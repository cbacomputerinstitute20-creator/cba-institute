        <h2>Introduction to Education in India</h2>
        <p>India's education system is one of the largest in the world, with over 1.5 million schools, 8.5 million teachers, and 250 million children enrolled. It encompasses early childhood, primary, secondary, higher, and vocational education. The system is managed by central, state, and local governments, with significant reforms driven by policies like the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. This page serves as a comprehensive resource on India's education landscape, covering history, structures, challenges, and future directions.</p>

      <section id="history">
        <h2>History of Education in India</h2>
        <p>Education in India dates back to ancient times with the Gurukula system, where students lived with gurus. Institutions like Taxila (8th century BCE) and Nalanda were global centers for learning. Islamic influences introduced madrassas, blending subjects like philosophy and mathematics. British colonial rule, through the English Education Act of 1835 (Macaulayism), prioritized English-medium education for an elite class, neglecting mass education. Christian missions established schools and promoted vernacular education. Post-independence in 1947, commissions like Radhakrishnan (1948–49) and Kothari (1964–66) shaped modern policies. The National Policy on Education (1986) emphasized science and traditional elements. The RTE Act (2009) made education a fundamental right, and NEP 2020 introduced a 5+3+3+4 structure.</p>
        <p>In the 1950s, community development programs expanded rural education. The 1990s saw Supreme Court interventions leading to Article 21A. Pre-independence, deaf education focused on oral methods; post-independence, services grew but challenges remain.</p>

      <section id="current-system-school">
        <h2>Current System: School Education</h2>
        <p>School education includes pre-primary (ages 3-6, optional via Anganwadi), primary (ages 6-11, Classes I-V), lower secondary (ages 11-14, Classes VI-VIII), and higher secondary (ages 14-18, Classes IX-XII). NEP 2020 shifts to 5+3+3+4: foundational (activity-based), preparatory, middle, and secondary stages. Subjects cover math, science, languages, and vocational topics. Board exams at Classes 10 and 12 are conducted by CBSE, CISCE, or state boards. Enrollment is high at primary (95%), but drops at secondary (69%). Vocational integration starts at secondary level.</p>
        <p>Types of schools: Government (83% elementary), aided private, unaided private (English-medium). Home-schooling is legal. Reservations up to 50% for SC/ST/OBC.</p>
